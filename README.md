# erb-template

Hi! This is my Electron React Boilerplate template.

## IMPORTANT NOTE

This project is using the existing [Electron React Boilerplate](https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate/electron-react-boilerplate) project as a base.
I don't guarantee that this project will be updated with the latest changes from the original project.

## What have you modified?

-   Used pnpm instead of yarn
-   Customized the [.editorconfig](.editorconfig) a bit
-   Removed husky as it didn't work with Github Desktop
-   and added postcss and tailwindcss

You can click the "Use this template" button to create a new repository with this template. Hope you enjoy!
